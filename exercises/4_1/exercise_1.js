// Make five programs, one for each basic arithmetic operation. 
// Your program must have two variables, a and b, defined at the beginning with the values ​​to be operated.
// Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, module

let a = 3;
let b = 7;

// Program 1 - Addition

let x = a + b;
console.log(x);

// Program 2 - Subtraction

let x = a - b;
console.log(x);

// Program 3 - Multiplication

let x = a * b;
console.log(x);

// Program 4 - Divison

let x = a / b;
console.log(x);

// Program 5 - Module

let x = a % b;
console.log(x);
